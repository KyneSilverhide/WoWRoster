WoWRoster
=========
WoWRoster is a web application to build a World of Warcraft raid roster from the official armory. Can be used to check which raid buffs and cooldowns are available in your roster.

[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/KyneSilverhide/WoWRoster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changelog-)

# Demo
There is a live demo available here : [WoWRoster](http://ks305642.kimsufi.com/kyne/WoWRoster/)

# Installation
I'm not planning on hosting the application for now. But you can actually run it on your computer very easily :
* Download the full project
* Open the index.html in your browser
* *You are done* :)

# Features
* Access to any guild on EU, US, KR and TW regions.
* Display all your members, or only the one at lvl 100
* Search by name, class, specialization or level
* Add or remove your members to the roster with a single click
* Display which buffs will be available based on the current roster (handle exclusive buffs sur as a warrior cry)
* Display the ratio of plate/armor/leather/cloth and the class distribution
* Save rosters (by guild)
* Import them directly from the WoW calendar, by using a very small addon

# Add on
I've created a small WoW addon (called WoWRosterExport) that will generate an export of any guild calendar event, so you can directly import the member list into a new roster in this web application.
To download the addon, simply go to Curse : http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/wowrosterexport
You'll find instructions on how to use (and install) this addon.

# Planned Features
* Search by role?
* Export?
