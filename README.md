WoWRoster
=========

Web application to build a World of Warcraft raid roster from the official armory. Can be used to check which raid buffs are available.

# Demo
There is a live demo available here : [WoWRoster](http://ks305642.kimsufi.com/kyne/WoWRoster/)

# Installation
I'm not planning on hosting the application for now. But you can actually run it on your computer very easily :
* Download the full project
* Open the index.html in your browser
* *You are done* :)

# Features
* Access to any guild on EU, US, KR and TW regions. 
* Display all your members, or only the one at lvl 100
* Search by name, class, specialization or level
* Add or remove your members to the roster with a single click
* Display which buffs will be available based on the current roster

# Planned Features
* Warn you when your raid composition is incorrect (more or less than 3 tanks, no healer, etc.)
* Handle exclusive buffs (A warrior can only have one "cry" active. But for now, it will consider both buffs as "available")
